## Career Objectives

I enjoy the quantitative aspect of the financial industry. I find the financial modeling the most intersting, exciting and intriguing element. I majored in Finance to have a thorough understanding of the financial industry, and minored in data science to build upon the analytical and quantitative aspect of my work. I aim to work in a role where I can leverage and expand upon both skillsets.
